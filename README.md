# Landing Page Project

This project is a simple landing page built using only HTML and CSS, following the design provided in the assignment. The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and functional landing page that contains multiple sections and a footer.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment asks you to create a landing page with four main sections and a footer, utilizing HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. The following steps outline the process for completing this project:

1. **Download the design images** (Full Design and Color and Fonts) provided in the assignment to get an idea of what the landing page should look like.
2. **Build the structure in HTML** by creating the main sections and footer. Focus on getting the content in place before styling.
3. **Style the page with CSS**, starting with the layout and design elements. Remember, you can use Flexbox for alignment, as seen in the exercises.
4. **Commit often** to keep track of changes and progress.

**Note**: There is no need to make this project mobile-responsive for now, as that will be covered in later lessons.
